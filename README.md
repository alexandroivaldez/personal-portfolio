# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This space showcases a collection of my past projects and occasionally highlights my current works. Each project serves as a testament to various skills I've cultivated along my coding journey.

## Portfolio Design

I've crafted this personal portfolio to emulate the aesthetic of a Twitter clone, (I'll have to update it to look like X now). The technologies used in its development include:

- **React**: For building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: For server-side scripting.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web development.
- **Netlify**: Hosting service for deploying and managing the portfolio.

Feel free to explore the projects, and I hope you enjoy your visit!
